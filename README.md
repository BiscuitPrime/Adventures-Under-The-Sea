# Adventures Under The Sea

A small isometric turn-based game, developed as part of our <a href="https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/">school's</a> C++ course.
Made over two weeks, using **Visual Studio**.

### Scenario :
The story takes place in 1867. 15 days ago, off the coast of the Lancashire, three Spanish corvettes disappeared. Rare witnesses claim that the boats were destroyed by creatures rising from the abyss, octocpuses, crabs and squids of grotesque proportions and features. Fearing the worst for their trade, the British governement has dispatched its new combat-ready submarine, the _Nautilus_, commanded by none other than you, to purge these heretical abominations. You now dive into the dark abyss, searching for your preys. But beware, for in the deepest reaches of our planet might lurk some terrifying secrets forgotten by all. Secrets that were never meant to be brought to the sunlight again.

### Gameplay :

The game is turn-based, switching from your turn to the enemies'. You may, using your **mouse**, select a **movement** and **attack**, to try and take out the monsters lurking in the depths.

Keep an eye out on your oxygen bar ! Use **bubbles** to replenish it.
